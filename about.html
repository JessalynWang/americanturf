     <h4>My name is Karly Gills, a senior at Arcadia High School and a part of Mr. Vo’s period 2 AP Environmental Science class. I am on the varsity softball team and played on the water polo team for 2 years. I have been playing softball and baseball since i was 5 and it is my favorite sport. I also very much enjoy snowboarding and water sports such as fishing, wakeboarding, skiing, and jet skiing. My favorite shows are “This is Us” and “Shooter”; Me and my best friend, Jake, watch it every weekend! Environmental Science is the only AP I have ever taken at Arcadia High and so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it. With this Family Garden Project, my goal is to be able to make a variety of good meals with my own hands. I am excited to be able to grow my own crops and use them to cook items that I love.</h4>
