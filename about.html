       <h4 style="text-align: center">Welcome to the Murican’ Turf! Using our knowledge about the environment and a single square meter of land, we plan to grow the finest produce in the U.S. for half a year and then dip. During our season of labor, we will humbly donate our fresh herbs and vegetables to craft exquisite dishes and feed the starving juniors and seniors of AHS. The Murican’ Turf encourages a sustainable, healthy environment, as well as a healthy diet!<br><br>Search our website for the secrets to growing a successful garden!</h4>

     <h4>My name is Serop Kelkelian and I am a senior at Arcadia High School. I am part of Mr. Vo’s period 2 APES class. I have played on the school water polo team for four years and have been on varsity since my sophomore year. I love to play hockey and ski during my freetime. I love spending time with my family and watching TV with my dogs. My favorite shows are “Archer” and “Last Man Standing”. This is the first AP class I have taken at this school and I have had a blast so far!!! In this project, my hope is to be able to grow vegetables and fruits that I love to cook with. I think it is very important to know where we get our food and produce.</h4>

     <h4>My name is Karly Gills, a senior at Arcadia High School and a part of Mr. Vo’s period 2 AP Environmental Science class. I am on the varsity softball team and played on the water polo team for 2 years. I have been playing softball and baseball since i was 5 and it is my favorite sport. I also very much enjoy snowboarding and water sports such as fishing, wakeboarding, skiing, and jet skiing. My favorite shows are “This is Us” and “Shooter”; Me and my best friend, Jake, watch it every weekend! Environmental Science is the only AP I have ever taken at Arcadia High and so far I have thoroughly enjoyed it. With this Family Garden Project, my goal is to be able to make a variety of good meals with my own hands. I am excited to be able to grow my own crops and use them to cook items that I love.</h4>

      <h4>My name is Jessalyn Wang and I am a senior at Arcadia High School. I’m in Mr. Vo’s period 2 APES class. I have been on varsity swim for 4 years and am playing my third year of water polo. My hobbies include drawing, reading and coding. I love sleeping, playing games, and binge-watching Netflix TV shows in my free time. APES is one of the my most favorite AP classes that I have ever taken, and I hope to learn cooking skills throughout this project, especially because I will be attending college next year and I’m determined not to experience freshman-15.</h4>

      <h4>Salute! My name is Aramis. Born and raised in LA, I’m your typical Cali-boy. I’ve reached the final year of high school, and have the honor of spending my final year here as a part of Mr. Vo’s Period 2 APES class. Outside of school, I play ice-hockey and water polo and am pursuing to play either sport in college. I’ve been on the ice since I was 2 years old, and in the pool for 7 years. Water is my domain. When I’m not competing, I spend my weekends working 4-5 hours on average in the yard with my grandfather. I look forward to this project, planting and growing is my specialty. I need to learn how to cook like Serop.</h4>
